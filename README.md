### 1. Create React App and Login page and User UI with settings page
Upon first login, make them input the following...

Main fields: Name, age, picture of you, employer or potential employee, field.\
For employers: Company, preferred education, preferred qualifications.\
For potential employees: Education, skills (create 5), elevator pitch.

To change the stuff, BAM Settings page.

### 2. Make a database of users separated by employer and potential employee
Different experience for employer and potential employee. Each ones feed should be exclusively the other category.

### 3. Add swiping function
CLOSING AND RE-OPENING SHOULD SAVE THE STATE (plz actually follow through with this).

If you swiped through all the users, ask for a re-cycle.

### 4. Add way to connect people
Make a chat app (woo) that connects employer to employee if both swiped right.
